Brian and Andy are having an argument about the perceptron algorithm. They have a dataset that the perceptron cannot seem to classify (that is, it fails to converge to a solution). Andy reasons that if he could collect more examples, that might solve the problem by making the data set linearly separable and then the perceptron algorithm will converge. Brian claims that collecting more examples will not help. Which one of them is correct?
