If you can't (or don't want to) install Meteor locally, we recommend checking out [Nitrous.io](http://nitrous.io/).

Nitrous.io is a service that lets you run apps and edit their code right in your browser, and we've written [a short guide](https://www.discovermeteor.com/blog/meteor-nitrous) to help you get set up.

You can simply follow that guide up to (and including) the "Installing Meteor" section, and then follow along with the book again starting from the "Creating a Simple App" section of this chapter.
