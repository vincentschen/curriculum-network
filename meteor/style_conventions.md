# Underscores vs CamelCase

The only thing we'll say about the age-old underscore (`my_variable`) vs camelCase (`myVariable`) debate is that it doesn't really matter which one you pick as long as you stick to it.

In this book, we're using camelCase because it's the usual JavaScript way of doing things (after all, it's JavaScript, not java_script!).

The only exceptions to this rule are file names, which will use underscores (`my_file.js`), and CSS classes, which use hyphens (`.my-class`). The reason for this is that in the filesystem, underscores are most common, while the CSS syntax itself already uses hyphens (`font-family`, `text-align`, etc.).
