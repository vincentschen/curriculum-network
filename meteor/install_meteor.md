# Install Meteor

To begin with, if you're on Mac OS or Linux you can install Meteor by opening a terminal window and typing:

```bash
curl https://install.meteor.com | sh
```

If you're running Windows, refer to the [install instructions](https://www.meteor.com/install) on the Meteor site.

This will install the meteor executable onto your system and have you ready to use Meteor.
