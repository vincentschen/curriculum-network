# Finding Files

Meteor is great at finding files. No matter where you put your code in the `/client` directory, Meteor will find it and compile it properly. This means you never need to manually write include paths for JavaScript or CSS files.

It also means you could very well put all your files in the same directory, or even all your code in the same file. But since Meteor will compile everything to a single minified file anyway, we'd rather keep things well-organized and use a cleaner file structure.
