# QuickSort Module 
## Features 
- Multiple tabs for module displaying varied information
- Interactive, "bite-size" examples

## Rationale 
- Understanding of the algorithm, as opposed to plug and chug of code bits. 
- Video/Demo, followed by interactive aspects -- no code!!! 

## Looking Forward 
- Drag and Drop Interactivity? 
- Compile/run user code? 

## Notes
https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/algorithms/quick-sort/a/overview-of-quicksort
- References in mergesort in curriculum. Not applicable in our model?

## Contact 
- Please reach out if we think we should refactor this to be incorporated!
